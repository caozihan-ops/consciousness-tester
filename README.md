# consciousness-tester
A Python project for consciousness state simulation.
## Features

- Simulate consciousness states: blur, clear, void
- Switch between different personality styles: neutral, poetic
- Query explanations for key concepts like PSM, egocentric frame, and body schema
- Interactive command-line interface with help commands

## Usage

Run the Python script and follow the on-screen prompts to input commands like:

- `blur` / `clear` / `void` to describe your conscious state
- `style:neutral` or `style:poetic` to switch personality style
- `explanation:<term>` to get explanation of key terms, e.g. `explanation:psm`
- `help` to see available commands
- `exit` to quit the program

## About

This project is a learning tool for understanding consciousness models and exploring phenomenological self-states. Developed by Cao Zihan as part of a personal research and programming journey.
